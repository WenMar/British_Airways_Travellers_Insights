# British_Airways_Travellers_Insights

The aim of this project was to gather insights into the experiences of UK travellers flying with British Airways.

To achieve this, I first web scraped a website with airline reviews (airlinequality.com), collecting data on reviews, countries, ratings, and dates. The data were then processed and analysed, highlighting the following insights:

**Average rating:** 4.60/10
**Review Sentiments:**
Overall: 48.4% positive, 9.5% neutral, 42.1% negative
UK-specific: 56.8% positive, 10.6% neutral, 32.6% negative
**Word Cloud Analysis:**
A word cloud was generated for the negative reviews, revealing that the most frequent terms were: "business class," "issues with the seat," "meal," "service," and "customer service."
